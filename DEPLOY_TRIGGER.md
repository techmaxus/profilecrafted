Last updated: 2025-08-10 19:32 - CRITICAL: Force Vercel to use latest commit with TypeScript fixes

## Issue Resolution
Vercel was stuck on commit db49562 instead of latest commit 4ba65db with TypeScript fixes.
This commit forces Vercel to synchronize with the latest code containing:
- Type casting fixes for ScoreWithTips
- Missing feedback parameter for regenerateEssay
- ESLint configuration to allow warnings
